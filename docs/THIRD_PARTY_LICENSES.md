- **Usage in Replyf**:
  - Structured exercise metadata reference for deterministic matching.
  - Approved imported static exercise demonstration images stored locally in `public/exercises/{slug}/`.
  - Provenance tracked on every imported file (`source: 'free-exercise-db'`, `sourceCommit`, `sourcePath`, `assetHash`, `license: 'Unlicense'`).
- **Provenance Retention**:
  - Source attribution and provenance are permanently retained in `lib/data/exercise-dataset-mapping.ts` and `public/exercises/manifest.json`.

## 2. azilRababe/Exercises_Dataset

- **Repository**: [https://github.com/azilRababe/Exercises_Dataset.git](https://github.com/azilRababe/Exercises_Dataset.git)
- **Pinned Commit**: `29145279a39a2675f5e4ade584a50718f71cfa58`
- **Repository License**: MIT License
- **Media Provenance & Rights Separation**:
  - **CRITICAL NOTICE**: Repository MIT ≠ Every GIF automatically MIT.
  - The repository's own README explicitly states that contributed exercise media must comply with applicable copyright and licensing requirements. Many GIFs within the dataset originate from third-party fitness websites (such as `fitnessprogramer.com`).
  - Therefore, individual GIFs are treated as unverified third-party assets.
- **Replyf Policy**:
  - Unverified animated assets from this repository remain marked `referenceOnly: true` with `verification.rights = 'unverified'`.
  - **Unverified GIFs are NEVER bundled into Replyf production assets (`public/exercises/`).**
  - Used strictly for GIF coverage discovery and candidate comparison.

## 3. ExerciseDB API & Dataset

- **Repository / Hosted API**:
  - [https://github.com/ExerciseDB/exercisedb-api.git](https://github.com/ExerciseDB/exercisedb-api.git) (Pinned Commit: `401ef93437a160f86927fee43b8e692532d04469`)
  - [https://oss.exercisedb.dev/](https://oss.exercisedb.dev/)
- **License & Rights Separation**:
  - **Repository Code**: AGPL-3.0 License
  - **Hosted Free API**: Subject to ExerciseDB / AscendAPI terms (rate-limited, non-commercial use tiers).
  - **Media Demonstrations**: Third-party animation demonstrations.
- **Replyf Policy**:
  - The Replyf `/exercises` catalog does NOT depend on the hosted API at runtime. Exercise metadata remains 100% offline-first and self-contained.
  - ExerciseDB media is NOT bundled into production unless applicable commercial redistribution rights are explicitly secured.
  - Candidate records remain `referenceOnly: true`.

## 4. ExerciseDB Muscle Visualizer API

- **Repository**: [https://github.com/ExerciseDB/muscle-visualizer-api.git](https://github.com/ExerciseDB/muscle-visualizer-api.git)
- **Pinned Commit**: `3177d1ce2c9ab382fd875901fa4c6c86b64462c0`
- **Purpose**: Dynamic anatomical visualization, muscle highlighting, and workout heatmap presentation.
- **Usage Boundary**:
  - Used strictly for anatomy/muscle visualization concepts.
  - **NOT used as an exercise movement GIF/demonstration source.**
  - Replyf's canonical anatomy taxonomy (`lib/anatomy/anatomy-definitions.ts`) remains the authoritative domain model.

## 5. MuscleMap

- **Repository**: [https://github.com/melihcolpan/MuscleMap.git](https://github.com/melihcolpan/MuscleMap.git)
- **Author**: Melih Colpan
- **License**: MIT License
- **Usage in Replyf**:
  - Male and female body silhouette SVG vector coordinate geometry (`components/anatomy/muscle-map-model.tsx`).
